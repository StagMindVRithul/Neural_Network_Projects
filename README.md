# Neural Network Projects from Basic to Advanced

Welcome to the **Neural Network Projects from Basic to Advanced** repository! This collection is designed to help you explore neural networks, starting with fundamental concepts and gradually advancing to more complex models and use cases.

## üåü Projects Overview

1. **Project 1: Brease Cancer Classification with Neural Network**
   - The project involves analyzing the breast cancer dataset to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for classification tasks.
   - Conducted EDA to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
   - Visualized a QQ plot to evaluate data distribution.
   - Applied Power Transformers and Quantile Transformers to achieve a normal distribution of the data.
   - Checked whether the dataset was balanced or imbalanced.
   - Removed outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to clean the data.
   - This systematic approach ensures robust preprocessing and sets the foundation for building an accurate classification model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).


*(More projects to be added soon!)*
